# What is this?
This is a prayer mill. 

Buddhist monks back in the day were the first hackers when they replaced
tedious and boring human prayer with a prayer mill. Prayers could be added to a cylinder and,
when passersby spun the cylinder (or it was done manually using a counterweight), the prayers 
from the roll inside streamed towards the heavens. 

In those times, the skills of writing were limited and so was the space inside those prayer mills. 
And the spinning was limited to how fast a person could turn the mill or how many people would travel
to the large mills in sacred places. 

Today we can do better.

So this is a web service where people can
 * Add their thoughts and prayers to the roll inside the mill
 * Add speed to the mill so it spins and prayers stream forth
 * see the the prayers as they emerge
