# What is this?
This is a prayer mill. 

Buddhist monks back in the day were the first hackers when they replaced
tedious and boring human prayer with a prayer mill. Prayers could be added to a cylinder and,
when passersby spun the cylinder (or it was done manually using a counterweight), the prayers 
from the roll inside streamed towards the heavens. 

In those times, the skills of writing were limited and so was the space inside those prayer mills. 
And the spinning was limited to how fast a person could turn the mill or how many people would travel
to the large mills in sacred places. 

Today we can do better.
 
 # What does it do
  * `/add?prayer={prayer}` adds a prayer to the roll
  * `/roll` returns all the prayers that have been sent towards the sky
  * `/stream` is a SSE stream of all prayers as they come along
  * `/spin` spins the prayer wheel so the prayers keep on going
